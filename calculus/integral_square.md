To find the area of a square of side length 2 using integral calculus, you can use the method of definite integration. Definite integration is used to find the area between a function and the x-axis over a certain interval.

### Here's the process:

1) Define the function that represents one side of the square. In this case, the function is a constant function f(x) = 2.

2) Define the interval over which you want to find the area. For a square of side length 2, the interval is [0,2].

3) Set up the definite integral using the function and the interval. The definite integral to find the area between f(x) = 2 and the x-axis from x = 0 to x = 2 is given by:
```
∫[0,2] 2 dx
```
4) Evaluate the definite integral by finding the antiderivative of the function and plugging in the limits of integration. The antiderivative of 2 is 2x and the definite integral becomes:
```
∫[0,2] 2 dx = (2x)|[0,2] = 2(2) - 2(0) = 4
```
5) The final step is to find the area by evaluating the definite integral obtained in step 4. 
- The area of the square is 4 square units.So, the area of the square of side length 2x2 is 4 square units.
- The definite integral is a mathematical concept that gives the total area under a curve (or between a curve and the x-axis) over a given interval. In this case, the definite integral of the function f(x) = 2 over the interval [0,2] is being evaluated.
- The antiderivative of 2 is 2x, the antiderivative is a way to find the area under the curve using calculus, we need to find the antiderivative of 2 and then we will evaluate it for the limits of integration.

#### So, the definite integral of f(x) = 2 from x = 0 to x = 2 is:
```
[2x]0^2 = 22 - 20 = 4
```
It can be read as the integral of 2x from 0 to 2, which is the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 2 from x = 0 to x = 2, and it is equal to 4.


--------------------------------

The integral is written in the standard notation ∫[a,b] f(x) dx, where a and b are the limits of integration, and f(x) is the function being integrated.

Step 1: Identify the function being integrated:

In this case, the function being integrated is 2.

Step 2: Identify the limits of integration:

The limits of integration are 0 and 2, which means we are finding the area under the curve of the function from x = 0 to x = 2.

Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral:

The definite integral is the area under the curve of the function from the lower limit to the upper limit.
```
∫[0,2] 2 dx = (2x)|[0,2] = 2(2) - 2(0) = 4
```
So, the definite integral of 2 dx from 0 to 2 is equal to 4.

Step 4: Add the constant of integration if it is a indefinite integral

In this case, the integral is definite, so no constant of integration is needed.
```
∫[0,2] 2 dx = 4
```
